# Red-White-Wine-Prediction
- Model that predicts Red and White Wine quality grading through utilizing linear regression
  
- Data used in prediction results:
   1 - fixed acidity
   2 - volatile acidity
   3 - citric acid
   4 - residual sugar
   5 - chlorides
   6 - free sulfur dioxide
   7 - total sulfur dioxide
   8 - density
   9 - pH
   10 - sulphates
   11 - alcohol
  
- Predicts Quality from 1 - 10 purely through numerical physicochemical properties
